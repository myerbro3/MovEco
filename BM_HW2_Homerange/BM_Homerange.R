# MCP and KDE rely on data with no autocorrelation. But
# how do we check for autocorrelation to determine if # 
# we need to thin data further?
# One approach is by calculating autocorrelation functions
# We do so for each individual using our 30min sampled data:
par( mfrow = c( 2,3 ) )
#based on direction
for( i in 1:dim(trks.thin)[1] ){
  #select x location of each individual
  x <- trks.thin %>% dplyr::filter( id == i ) %>% 
    #select( x_ )
    #select( y_ )
    #select(speed)
    select( alt )
  #calculate autocorrelation function:
  acf( x, lag.max = 1000,
       main = paste0( "individual = ", i ) )
  #Note you can modify the lag.max according to your data 
}

# Are our data autocorrelated?
# Answer: THE AUTOCORRELATION COEFFICIENTS ARE CLOSE TO 0 AND WITHIN THE 
# CONFIDENCE INTERVAL LINES FOR MOST TIME STEPS. HOWEVER, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT 
# AUTOCORRELATION IN THE BEGINNING OF EACH GRAPH
# 

# We start by calculating MCP and KDE for each individual:
ranges <- trks.thin %>% 
  #we group tibbles for each individual:
  nest( data = -"id" ) %>% 
  #then add estimates from two home range measures:
  mutate(
    #Minimum Convex Polygon
    hr_mcp = map(data, ~ hr_mcp(., levels = c(0.5, 0.9)) ),
    #Kernel density estimator
    hr_kde = map(data, ~ hr_kde(., levels = c(0.5, 0.9)) ),
    #also calculate the sample size for each individual
    n = map_int( data, nrow )
  )  
#view
ranges

#plot KDEs:
#select tibble 
ranges %>%
  #choose one home range method at a time
  hr_to_sf( hr_kde, id, n ) %>%

# Comment on this graph
#Answer: KDE: THE HOMERANGES FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS FALL WITHIN ~10-200 SQ KM, EXCEPT
# FOR INDIVIDUAL #7 WHO HAS A MUCH LARGER HOMERANGE. REFERRING BACK TO THE PREVIOUS PLOTS
# NOTHING IMMEDIATELY STANDS OUT AS TO WHY THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS A MUCH LARGER HOMERANGE, 
# OTHER THAN IT MAY BE INITIATING POST-BREEDING MIGRATION EARLIER THAN OTHERS, OR
# ITS POST MIGRATION TRAVEL SPEED IS MUCH FASTER. 

# MCP: THE HOMERANGES ESTIMATED BY MCP ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN THOSE ESTIMATED BY KDE
# INTERESTINGLY, THIS METHODS CAPTURES THE INCREASE IN HOME RANGE FOR INDIVIDUAL #7
# BUT ALSO CAPTURES A REDUCTION IN HOMERANGE SIZE AFTER THE PEAK THAT IS NOT CAPTURED
# BY KDE. 
# 
# Try a different level and comment on new output
# Answer: USING THE 90% LEVEL, THE TRENDS IN KDE HOMERANGE REMAIN MOSTLY CONSISTENT
# IN COMPARISION TO ONE ANOTHER, ONLY THE SCALE OF HOMERANGE SIZE SIGNIFICANTLY 
# INCREASES

# THE TRENDS IN MCP HOMERANGE VARY BETWEEN THE 0.5 AND 0.9 LEVELS, AND THE CHANGE IN 
# HOMERANGE SIZE IS LARGER 


# we can also calculate mean and CIs of area in Km for each id:
ci_wk <- hr_area %>% group_by(estimator, id, level ) %>% 
  summarise( m = mean(area_km), 
             se = sd(area_km) / sqrt(n()), 
             me = qt(0.975, n() - 1) * se, 
             lci = m - me, uci = m + me)
#view
ci_wk %>% filter( level  == 0.9 )

# plot home ranges of each individual average across weeks:
ci_wk %>% 
  #choose desired level
  filter( level  == 0.9 ) %>% 
  ggplot(.) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(x = as.character(id), y = m, 
                  ymin = lci, ymax = uci, col = estimator), 
                  position = position_dodge2(width = 0.5)) +
  ylim( 0,2000 ) +
  theme_light(base_size = 15 )  
# Comment on output
# Answer: AS EXPECTED FROM ANALYZING THE PREVIOUS GRAPHS, THE MCP ESTIMATES SMALLER
# HOMERANGES THAN THE KDE DOES. INDIVIDUAL #7 HAS A SE OF 161, AND A MEAN OF 569,
# SEVERAL TIMES LARGER THAN THE VALUES FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS. IT MAS A MEDIAN MUCH 
# LARGER THAN OTHER INDIVIDUALS AS WELL. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LARGE VALUES DISCUSSED
# ABOVE
#

# What other plots would be relevant for your specific question?
# Answer:
# TO UNDERSTAND THE LARGE VARIATION IN THE HOMERANGE OF #7, 
# IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO VISUALIZE THE POINTS WITH TIMESTAMPS 
# AND TO CALCULATE DISTANCE MOVED
# 

# Adapt to data here if possible. If not, provide details of what #
# is missing from this dataset to achieve the desired plot?
# Answer: 


# DISTANCE FOR ALL POINTS IN WEEK 26
# Extract the coordinates for individual #7
coords <- trks.thin %>% dplyr::filter(id == 7, wk==26) %>% dplyr::select(x_, y_)

# Calculate the distance between successive locations
distances <- sqrt(diff(coords$x_)^2 + diff(coords$y_)^2)

# add distances to trks.thin.ind7
trks.thin.ind7 <- trks.thin.ind7 %>%
  dplyr::mutate(dist = c(0, distances))  

# Plot tracks for individual #7 # labeled by time
ggplot(trks.thin.ind7, aes(x = x_, y = y_)) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = t_), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5, hjust = 1)

# Plot tracks for individual #7 # labeled by distance
ggplot(trks.thin.ind7, aes(x = x_, y = y_)) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = dist), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5)

# IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAST MOVEMENT WE HAVE RECORDED FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL
# IS 16,091 METERS
# NOW THAT THIS IS IDENTIFIED, IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE REMOVED FROM THE DATASET
# NEW KDE AND MCP CAN BE CALCULATED FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL AND THESE VALUES WILL BE 
# MUCH MORE REALISTIC
