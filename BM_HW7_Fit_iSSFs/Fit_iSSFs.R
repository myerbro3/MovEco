# Answer: 
# PERENNIAL: THE STEP LENGTH MAXIMUM IN ALL THREE PERCENTAGES IS SIMILAR BETWEEN USED

# ANNUAL: THERE IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN STEP LENGTH BETWEEN USED AND UNUSED IN

#### Visualize results for top model ###
# One option that can help interpret results is by calculating #
# relative selection strength for two locations that are equal #
# except for 1 of the predictors. We demonstrate that approach here: #

# start by creating new dataframes that contain details for each #
# of the two hypothetical locations that we want to compare: 
# We focus on differences in sagebrush #
s1 <- data.frame( 
  annual_30m = 0, 
  perennial_30m = 0,
  shrub_30m = 0,
  sl_ = 1000,
  ta_ = 0 )
# now a second dataframe with higher sagebrush
s2 <- data.frame( 
  annual_30m = 1, 
  perennial_30m = 0,
  shrub_30m = 0,
  sl_ = 1000,
  ta_ = 0 )

# now we use log_rss() and our top model to calculate log-RSS 
lr1 <- log_rss( m1_sg, x1 = s1, x2 = s2 )
#  view
lr1$df

# we can shift to using a range for one of the distributions instead
# so that we  can make a plot of change:
#first we need to know what the individual experience
min( df_one$annual_30m ); max(df_one$annual_30m )
# use those values for prediction
s3 <- data.frame( 
  annual_30m = seq(from = round( min( df_one$annual_30m ),0), 
            to = round(max( df_one$annual_30m ),0), length.out = 100), 
  perennial_30m = 0,
  shrub_30m = 0,
  sl_ = 1000,
  ta_ = 0 )

# Calculate log-RSS for our top model
lr2 <- log_rss(m2_sg, s3, s1)

#the line depicts the log-RSS between each value of s1 relative to s2.

summary( m3 )

# Which model is our top model? 
# How do you interpret results from it?
# Answer:
AIC( m1); AIC( m2); AIC( m3)

# M2 IS THE MODEL WITH THE LOWEST AIC VALUE, HOWEVER M3 HAS AN AIC VALUE ONLY 4 GREAT THAN M2, WITH MANY MORE PARAMETERS. 
# ACOUNTING FOR THE INCREASE IN 2 AIC PER VARIABLE, THE M3 MODEL LIKELY HAS A LOWER "RAW" AIC VALUE. 

# BOTH MODELS IDENTIFY ANNUAL, LOG(SL_) AND COS(TA_A) AS IMPORTANT VARIABLES. M2 ALSO IDENTIFIES PERENNIAL AS AN IMPORTANT VARIABLE.

# What else could we add to our analysis?
# Answer: ALL INDIVIDUALS SELECT FOR HABITAT ABOVE THE MEAN, EXCEPT FOR 
# TWO INDIVIDUALS IN THE SHRUB COVER. MAYBE SUBSETTING SELECTION BY THE TIME
# OF DAY OR THE SEASON THE HABITAT IS SELECTED WOULD GIVE MORE INFORMATION. 
# MORE INDIVIDUALS WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL.
